# **MirrorMult Figma**
After making an [addon](https://github.com/ameya-g-git/mirror-mult-obj-bpy#user-content-fn-2-f7cce865578bb4eaa8c8a47d8d0de273) for Blender that utlizes the Array and Mirror modifiers to make symmetrical designs, I thought to myself, wouldn't this be a great feature for Figma too? So, I got to work learning JS and TS to make **MirrorMult Figma**!

___

## **How to use**:
1. Before running the plugin, make sure to select all the objects you want symmetrized.

2. Stay on MirrorMult for axis symmetry (horizontal & vertical), or click on the RotSymm tab for rotational symmetry.
